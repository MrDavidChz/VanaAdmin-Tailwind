# Vana -Tailwind & Vue.js Admin Template

Hello Everyone, This is Vinay from [ScriptMint](https://scriptmint.com), a Certified Laravel Developer from India. 

Vana is an attempt to build FREE, OPEN SOURCE Responsive template with [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com) & [VueJS](https://vuejs.org). It is in the early stage of development with basic layout & navigation which you can start using in your project. The plan is to design all the features listed in the sidebar one by one.
